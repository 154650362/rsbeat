  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  #enabled: true

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path

  #max_retries: 3

  # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Elasticsearch bulk API index request.
  # The default is 50.
  #bulk_max_size: 50

  # Configure http request timeout before failing an request to Elasticsearch.

#----------------------------- Console output ---------------------------------
#output.console:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  #enabled: true

  # Pretty print json event
  #pretty: false

#================================= Paths ======================================

# The home path for the rsbeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all other path settings and for miscellaneous files that come with the
# distribution (for example, the sample dashboards).
# If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the
# home path is the location of the binary.
#path.home:

# The configuration path for the rsbeat installation. This is the default
# base path for configuration files, including the main YAML configuration file
# and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
# configuration file, the default for the configuration path is the home path.
#path.config: ${path.home}

# The data path for the rsbeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all the files in which rsbeat needs to store its data. If not set by a
# CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the data path is a data
# subdirectory inside the home path.
#path.data: ${path.home}/data

# The logs path for a rsbeat installation. This is the default location for
# the Beat's log files. If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file,
# the default for the logs path is a logs subdirectory inside the home path.
#path.logs: ${path.home}/logs

#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag.
#dashboards.enabled: false

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#dashboards.url:

# The directory from where to read the dashboards. It is used instead of the URL
# when it has a value.
#dashboards.directory:

# The file archive (zip file) from where to read the dashboards. It is used instead
# of the URL when it has a value
#dashboards.file:

# If this option is enabled, the snapshot URL is used instead of the default URL.
#dashboards.snapshot: false

# The URL from where to download the snapshot version of the dashboards. By default
# this has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version.
#dashboards.snapshot_url

# In case the archive contains the dashboards from multiple Beats, this lets you
# select which one to load. You can load all the dashboards in the archive by
# setting this to the empty string.
#dashboards.beat: rsbeat

# The name of the Kibana index to use for setting the configuration. Default is ".kibana"
#dashboards.kibana_index: .kibana

# The Elasticsearch index name. This overwrites the index name defined in the
# dashboards and index pattern. Example: testbeat-*
#dashboards.index:

#================================ Logging ======================================
# There are three options for the log output: syslog, file, stderr.
# Under Windows systems, the log files are per default sent to the file output,
# under all other system per default to syslog.

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: info

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", "service"
# Multiple selectors can be chained.
#logging.selectors: [ ]

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: true

# If enabled, rsbeat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
# all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is true.
#logging.metrics.enabled: true

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#logging.metrics.period: 30s

# Logging to rotating files files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
# files.
logging.to_files: true
logging.files:
  # Configure the path where the logs are written. The default is the logs directory
  # under the home path (the binary location).
  #path: /var/log/rsbeat

  # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
  #name: rsbeat

  # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
  # automatically rotated
  #rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

  # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
  #keepfiles: 7
